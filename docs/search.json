    "text": ":octocat: Git and GitHub\nGit is a distributed Version Control System (VCS), which means it is a useful tool for easily tracking changes to your code, collaborating, and sharing. With Git you can track the changes you make to your project so you always have a record of what you‚Äôve worked on and can easily revert back to an older version if need be. It also makes working with others easier‚Äîgroups of people can work together on the same project and merge their changes into one final source!\nGitHub is a way to use the same power of Git all online with an easy-to-use interface. It‚Äôs used across the software world and beyond to collaborate and maintain the history of projects.\nGitHub is home to some of the most advanced technologies in the world. Whether you‚Äôre visualizing data or building a new game, there‚Äôs a whole community and set of tools on GitHub that can get you to the next step. This course starts with the basics of GitHub, but we‚Äôll dig into the rest later."

    "section": ":octocat: Understanding the GitHub flow",
    "text": ":octocat: Understanding the GitHub flow\nThe GitHub flow is a lightweight workflow that allows you to experiment and collaborate on your projects easily, without the risk of losing your previous work.\n\nRepositories\nA repository is where your project work happens‚Äìthink of it as your project folder. It contains all of your project‚Äôs files and revision history. You can work within a repository alone or invite others to collaborate with you on those files.\n\n\nCloning\nWhen a repository is created with GitHub, it‚Äôs stored remotely in the ‚òÅÔ∏è. You can clone a repository to create a local copy on your computer and then use Git to sync the two. This makes it easier to fix issues, add or remove files, and push larger commits. You can also use the editing tool of your choice as opposed to the GitHub UI. Cloning a repository also pulls down all the repository data that GitHub has at that point in time, including all versions of every file and folder for the project! This can be helpful if you experiment with your project and then realize you liked a previous version more. To learn more about cloning, read ‚ÄúCloning a Repository‚Äù.\n\n\nCommitting and pushing\nCommitting and pushing are how you can add the changes you made on your local machine to the remote repository in GitHub. That way your instructor and/or teammates can see your latest work when you‚Äôre ready to share it. You can make a commit when you have made changes to your project that you want to ‚Äúcheckpoint.‚Äù You can also add a helpful commit message to remind yourself or your teammates what work you did (e.g.¬†‚ÄúAdded a README with information about our project‚Äù).\nOnce you have a commit or multiple commits that you‚Äôre ready to add to your repository, you can use the push command to add those changes to your remote repository. Committing and pushing may feel new at first, but we promise you‚Äôll get used to it üôÇ"

    "section": "üíª GitHub terms to know",
    "text": "üíª GitHub terms to know\n\nRepositories\nWe mentioned repositories already, they are where your project work happens, but let‚Äôs talk a bit more about the details of them! As you work more on GitHub you will have many repositories which may feel confusing at first. Fortunately, your ‚ÄúGitHub dashboard‚Äù helps to easily navigate to your repositories and see useful information about them. Make sure you‚Äôre logged in to see it!\nRepositories also contain READMEs. You can add a README file to your repository to tell other people why your project is useful, what they can do with your project, and how they can use it. We are using this README to communicate how to learn Git and GitHub with you. üòÑ To learn more about repositories read ‚ÄúCreating, Cloning, and Archiving Repositories and ‚ÄúAbout README‚Äôs‚Äù.\n\n\nBranches\nYou can use branches on GitHub to isolate work that you do not want merged into your final project just yet. Branches allow you to develop features, fix bugs, or safely experiment with new ideas in a contained area of your repository. Typically, you might create a new branch from the default branch of your repository‚Äîmain. This makes a new working copy of your repository for you to experiment with. Once your new changes have been reviewed by a teammate, or you are satisfied with them, you can merge your changes into the default branch of your repository. To learn more about branching, read ‚ÄúAbout Branches‚Äù.\nNote: In this class, you will not be required to use branches.\n\n\nForks\nA fork is another way to copy a repository, but is usually used when you want to contribute to someone else‚Äôs project. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project and is very popular when contributing to open source software projects! To learn more about forking, read ‚ÄúFork a repo‚Äù\nNote: In this class, you will not be required to use forks.\n\n\nPull requests\nWhen working with branches, you can use a pull request to tell others about the changes you want to make and ask for their feedback. Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators and add more changes if need be. You can add specific people as reviewers of your pull request which shows you want their feedback on your changes! Once a pull request is ready-to-go, it can be merged into your main branch. To learn more about pull requests, read ‚ÄúAbout Pull Requests‚Äù.\nNote: In this course, you will not be required to use pull requests.\n\n\nIssues\nIssues are a way to track enhancements, tasks, or bugs for your work on GitHub. Issues are a great way to keep track of all the tasks you want to work on for your project and let others know what you plan to work on. You can also use issues to tell a favorite open source project about a bug you found or a feature you think would be great to add!\nFor larger projects, you can keep track of many issues on a project board. GitHub Projects help you organize and prioritize your work and you can read more about them in this ‚ÄúAbout Project boards document. You likely won‚Äôt need a project board for your assignments, but once you move on to even bigger projects, they‚Äôre a great way to organize your team‚Äôs work! You can also link together pull requests and issues to show that a fix is in progress and to automatically close the issue when someone merges the pull request. To learn more about issues and linking them to your pull requests, read ‚ÄúAbout Issues‚Äù.\n\n\nYour user profile\nYour profile page tells people the story of your work through the repositories you‚Äôre interested in, the contributions you‚Äôve made, and the conversations you‚Äôve had. You can also give the world a unique view into who you are with your profile README. You can use your profile to let future employers know all about you! To learn more about your user profile and adding and updating your profile README, read ‚ÄúManaging Your Profile README‚Äù.\n\n\nUsing markdown on GitHub\nYou might have noticed already, but you can add some fun styling to your issues, pull requests, and files. ‚ÄúMarkdown‚Äù is an easy way to style your issues, pull requests, and files with some simple syntax. This can be helpful to organize your information and make it easier for others to read. You can also drop in gifs and images to help convey your point! To learn more about using GitHub‚Äôs flavor of markdown, read ‚ÄúBasic Writing and Formatting Syntax‚Äù.\n\n\nEngaging with the GitHub community\nThe GitHub community is vast. There are many types of people who use GitHub in their day to day‚Äîstudents like you, professional developers, hobbyists working on open source projects, and explorers who are just jumping into the world of software development on their own. There are many ways you can interact with the larger GitHub community, but here are three places where you can start.\n\nStarring repositories\nIf you find a repository interesting or you want to keep track of it, star it! When you star a repository it‚Äôs also used as a signal to surface better recommendations on github.com/explore. If you‚Äôd like to get back to your starred repositories you can do so via your user profile. To learn more about starring repositories, read ‚ÄúSaving Repositories with Stars‚Äù.\n\n\nFollowing users\nYou can follow people on GitHub to receive notifications about their activity and discover projects in their communities. When you follow a user, their public GitHub activity will show up on your dashboard so you can see all the cool things they are working on. To learn more about following users, read ‚ÄúFollowing People‚Äù.\n\n\nBrowsing GitHub Explore\nGitHub Explore is a great place to do just that ‚Ä¶ explore :smile: You can find new projects, events, and developers to interact with.\nYou can check out the GitHub Explore website at github.com/explore. The more you intereact with GitHub the more tailored your Explore view will be."
